About Altas+ Tool:


**In the context of social IoT (SIoT), these object services delete several types of relationships increasing the degree of complexity of their representation. 
As these object services continue to be more widely available and exponentially growing, one of the main research 
challenges is to know how to model the variability related to their composition.

**The variability is defined by several choices of composition planes allowing all to achieve the same objective.

**Atlas+ is a new tool for generating composition plans that support variability.

**This tool is based on an architecture composed of modules allowing the configuration of variable planes in a configurable 
composition reference model so that they can be individualized according to preferences.

Objective of Atlas+ Tool: Realise the configurable IoT composition. 
                          A new language for the configurable Thing composition.
